Makefiles
=========

A repository containing Makefiles for different languages and building
methods.

Feel free to add your own Makefile and make a pull request.

## C

- **dynamic_lib**: build dynamic library
- **exe**: compile into a binary file

## Cordova

- **simple**: Makefile to build cordova project. You can develop into an
  *app* directory (default: app) and when you launch *make*, it minifies your js
  files, compile your less files into css files (sass coming soon). A complete
  article and tutorial will be available on http://blog.danny-willems.be.

- **with_jsoo**: Use [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) in your cordova application. It compiles your ocaml files into a js file. It's very similar to Makefile.cordova.

## CSS_JS

Minify CSS and JS files. Dev and prod mode available

## js_of_ocaml

[js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) project. Compile your ml files into js scripts to use them in a web browser.

## LaTeX
